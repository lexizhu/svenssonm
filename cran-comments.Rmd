## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Simplify the title.

* Modify the description part to make it more concise.

* Modify the 'Value' part of sresult.Rd to make it more concise.


## Test environments
* Local Windows 10 (devel and release), R 3.4.1
* ubuntu 14.04.5 (on travis-ci), R 3.4.1

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

One NOTE for this is a new submission.
