Description: This package contains functions for obtaining parameters' results of 
    Svensson's Method, including percentage agreement, systematic change and 
    individual change. Also, the contingency table can be generated by function in 
    this package. Svensson's Method is a rank-invariant nonparametric method for the 
    analysis of ordered scales which measures the level of change both from systematic 
    and individual aspects. For details about Svensson's Method, please refer to 
    Svensson E. Analysis of systematic and random differences between paired ordinal 
    categorical data [dissertation]. Stockholm: Almqvist & Wiksell International; 1993.
